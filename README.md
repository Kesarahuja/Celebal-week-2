# Celebal Assignment 2



## Topic
Create a Python program that implements a singly linked list using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Your implementation should include the following: A Node class to represent each node in the list. A LinkedList class to manage the nodes, with methods to: Add a node to the end of the list Print the list Delete the nth node (where n is a 1-based index) Include exception handling to manage edge cases such as: Deleting a node from an empty list Deleting a node with an index out of range Test your implementation with at least one sample list.
## Assignment Description
This assignment is a basic implementation of a singly linked list using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

It includes the ability to:

1. Add nodes to the end of the list

2. Print the entire list

3. Delete a node at a given position (1-based index)

4. Handle edge cases like invalid indexes or deleting from an empty list

This assigment is a great starting point for implementing OOPS Concepts!
